# Gipheed

The beginnings of a gif editing Android app. Currently it displays gifs from Giphy.com in three feeds (trending, search, and favorites) 
using the Giphy API. Gifs are displayed and animated using MediaPlayer and TextureView. Favorites are stored in an SQLite database locally on the device using a Content Provider.

A signed apk for install can be found in the app/Builds folder
